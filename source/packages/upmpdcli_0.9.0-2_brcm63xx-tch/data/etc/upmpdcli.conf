# Configuration file for upmpdcli, the UPnP Media Renderer front-end to MPD

#mpdhost = localhost

# Port for MPD. Can also be specified as -p port

# Save queue metadata to disk to allow persistence across restart, like MPD.
ohmetapersist = 1

# Mimimum interval (Seconds) between 2 saves of the cache. Setting this may

# inbetween).
