Description:  Avahi is an mDNS/DNS-SD (aka RendezVous/Bonjour/ZeroConf)
 implementation (library). It facilitates
 service discovery on a local network -- this means that
 you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and
 instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with,
 find printers to print to or find files being shared.
 This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X
 (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf')
 and is very convenient.
 .
 The libavahi package contains the mDNS/DNS-SD shared libraries,
 used by other programs. Specifically, it provides
 libavahi-core and libavahi-common libraries.
 .
 Selecting this package modifies the build configuration
 so that avahi packages are built without support for D-BUS enabled;
 it does not generate a separate binary of its own.
