Description: udproxy makes it possible to convert UDP IPTV streams into HTTP streams which can be viewed even over WLANs. HTTP streams do not generate huge amounts of multicast traffic, so a sd stream only takes about 300k. Interesting for peoply who have IPTV at home and do not want to rent multiple decoders from their provider but just use their own streaming client (for example popcornhour/mediatomb/vlc).
