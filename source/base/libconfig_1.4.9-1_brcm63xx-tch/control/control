Description: Libconfig is a simple library for manipulating structured configuration files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML. And unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string parsing in application code. Libconfig is very compact -- just 38K for the stripped C shared library (less than one-fourth the size of the expat XML parser library) and 66K for the stripped C++ shared library. This makes it well-suited for memory-constrained systems like handheld devices.
