Take care that you don't include apache at the moment into your image please select it only as module because busybox will override /usr/sbin/httpd. It'll be solved soon. If you need to include this package in the image anyway, remove httpd from busybox (Base system --> Configuration --> Networking Utilities --> httpd). Also you should take care for the initscripts, apache's httpd isn't compatible with the one from busybox, so if you want to use apache for running your webif, you'll need to change the parameters in the scripts and configure the rest in /etc/httpd.conf.

Description: Alarm Pinger (apinger) is a little tool which monitors various IP devices by simple ICMP echo requests. There are various other tools, that can do this, but most of them are shell or perl scripts, spawning many processes, thus much CPU-expensive, especially when one wants continuous monitoring and fast response on target failure. Alarm Pinger is a single program written in C, so it doesn't need much CPU power even when monitoring many targets with frequent probes. Alarm Pinger supports both IPv4 and IPv6. The code have been tested on Linux and FreeBSD.

It facilitates service discovery on a local network -- this means that you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files being shared. This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf') and is very convenient. . This package implements IPv4LL, "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses" (IETF RFC3927), a protocol for automatic IP address configuration from the link-local 169.254.0.0/16 range without the need for a central server. It is primarily intended to be used in ad-hoc networks which lack a DHCP server.

Filename: confuse_2.7-1_brcm63xx-tch.ipk
Source: feeds/packages/libs/confuse
Description: libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under the terms of the ISC license, and written in C. It supports sections and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other sections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted strings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability to a program using a simple API. The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser library with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use and quick to integrate with your code. libConfuse was called libcfg before, but was changed to not confuse with other similar libraries.

Source: feeds/packages/net/lftp
Description: LFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program with command line interface. It supports FTP, HTTP, FISH, SFTP, HTTPS and FTPS protocols. GNU Readline library is used for input. Every operation in lftp is reliable, that is any non-fatal error is handled and the operation is retried automatically. So if downloading breaks, it will be restarted from the point automatically. Even if ftp server does not support REST command, lftp will try to retrieve the file from the very beginning until the file is transferred completely. This is useful for dynamic-ip machines which change their IP addresses quite often, and for sites with very bad internet connectivity. If you exit lftp when some jobs are not finished yet, lftp will move itself to nohup mode in background. The same happens when you have a real modem hangup or when you close an xterm. lftp has shell-like command syntax allowing you to launch several commands in parallel in background (&). It is also possible to group commands within () and execute them in background. All background jobs are executed in the same single process. You can bring a foreground job to background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command `wait' (or `fg' which is alias to `wait'). To list running jobs, use command `jobs'. Some commands allow redirecting their output (cat, ls, ...) to file or via pipe to external command. Commands can be executed conditionally based on termination status of previous command (&&, ||). lftp has builtin mirror which can download or update a whole directory tree. There is also reverse mirror (mirror -R) which uploads or updates a directory tree on server. There is command `at' to launch a job at specified time in current context, command `queue' to queue commands for sequential execution for current server, and much more. LFTP supports IPv6 for both FTP and HTTP protocols. For FTP protocol it uses method described in RFC2428. Other low level stuff supported: ftp proxy, http proxy, ftp over http, opie/skey, fxp transfers, socks. LFTP supports secure versions of the protocols FTP and HTTP: FTPS (explicit and implicit) and HTTPS. LFTP needs to be linked with an SSL library to support them. GNU TLS and OpenSSL are both supported as SSL backend.

It consists of the following parts: - A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization procedure of a process - A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to Syslog or STDERR - An API for writing PID files - An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with select() or poll() - An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog APIs like these are used in most daemon software available. It is not that simple to get it done right and code duplication is not a goal.

Source: feeds/packages/net/fwknop
Description: Fwknop implements an authorization scheme known as Single Packet Authorization (SPA) for Linux systems running iptables. This mechanism requires only a single encrypted and non-replayed packet to communicate various pieces of information including desired access through an iptables policy. The main application of this program is to use iptables in a default-drop stance to protect services such as SSH with an additional layer of security in order to make the exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much more difficult. This package contains the libfko shared library.

Description: OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its devices easily accessible. The underlying priciple is to create a virtual filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written. Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the fundemental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness rather than speed. This package contains the OWFS C-API library.

Source: feeds/packages/utils/rrdtool1
Description: RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature, server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and put friendly user interface on it. This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with separate dynamic linked libraries. This package contains a shared library, used by other programs.

Description: NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software library for network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures, etc. NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools. Sodium is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl (based on the latest released upstream version nacl-20110221), with a compatible API. The design choices, particularly in regard to the Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman function, emphasize security (whereas NIST curves emphasize "performance" at the cost of security), and "magic constants" in NaCl/Sodium have clear rationales. The same cannot be said of NIST curves, where the specific origins of certain constants are not described by the standards. And despite the emphasis on higher security, primitives are faster across-the-board than most implementations of the NIST standards.

Filename: libv4l_1.6.2-1_brcm63xx-tch.ipk
Source: feeds/packages/libs/libv4l
Description: libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2. libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many v4l2 drivers do not). libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.

It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use. mksh has UTF-8 support (in substring operations and the Emacs editing mode) and - while R50 corresponds to OpenBSD 5.5-cur- rent ksh (without GNU bash-like PS1 and fancy character clas- ses) - adheres to SUSv4 and is much more robust. The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards compli- ance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibi- lity to other modern shells - as well as a couple of its own) are available. It has sensible defaults as usual with BSD.

As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host. After it determines the address of each network hop between the machines, it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the quality of the link to each machine. As it does this, it prints running statistics about each machine.

Source: feeds/packages/utils/openocd
Description: OpenOCD provides on-chip programming and debugging support with a layered architecture of JTAG interface and TAP support including: - (X)SVF playback to faciliate automated boundary scan and FPGA/CPLD programming; - debug target support (e.g. ARM, MIPS): single-stepping, breakpoints/watchpoints, gprof profiling, etc; - flash chip drivers (e.g. CFI, NAND, internal flash); - embedded TCL interpreter for easy scripting. Several network interfaces are available for interacting with OpenOCD: telnet, TCL, and GDB. The GDB server enables OpenOCD to function as a "remote target" for source-level debugging of embedded systems using the GNU GDB program (and the others who talk GDB protocol, e.g. IDA Pro).

Description: OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its devices easily accessible. The underlying priciple is to create a virtual filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written. Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the fundemental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness rather than speed. This package contains the OWFS fuse filesystem.

Description: RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature, server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and put friendly user interface on it. This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with separate dynamic linked libraries. This package contains the rrdcgi tool used to create web pages containing RRD graphs based on templates.

It can be used either via simple wrapper scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and put friendly user interface on it. This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with separate dynamic linked libraries. This package contains command line tools used to manage RRDs.

Source: feeds/packages/net/rsync
Description: rsync is a program that allows files to be copied to and from remote machines in much the same way as rcp. It has many more options than rcp, and uses the rsync remote-update protocol to greatly speed up file transfers when the destination file already exists. The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the differences between two sets of files across the network link.

Description: Linux SCSI target framework (tgt) aims to simplify various SCSI target driver (iSCSI, Fibre Channel, SRP, etc) creation and maintenance. Key goals of the project are the clean integration into the scsi-mid layer and implementing a great portion of tgt in user space. Tgt consists of kernel-space and user-space code. The kernel-space component is included in upstream as of 2.6.20. Note that if you are interested in only iSCSI (probably you are), you need only the user-space code (any kernel version is fine).

SATP defines a protocol used for communication between any combination of unicast and anycast tunnel endpoints. It has less protocol overhead than IPSec in Tunnel mode and allows tunneling of every ETHER TYPE protocol (e.g. ethernet, ip, arp ...). SATP directly includes cryptography and message authentication based on the methods used by SRTP. It is intended to deliver a generic, scaleable and secure solution for tunneling and relaying of packets of any protocol. Unlike Anytun which is a full featured implementation uAnytun has no support for multiple connections or synchronisation. It is a small single threaded implementation intended to act as a client on small platforms.

Description: udproxy makes it possible to convert UDP IPTV streams into HTTP streams which can be viewed even over WLANs. HTTP streams do not generate huge amounts of multicast traffic, so a sd stream only takes about 300k. Interesting for peoply who have IPTV at home and do not want to rent multiple decoders from their provider but just use their own streaming client (for example popcornhour/mediatomb/vlc).

Description: libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2. libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many v4l2 drivers do not). libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary. This package contains the video4linux utilities.
